## Evernote Bugs <i class="icon icon-bug"></i>

### Cannot create notebook with AppleScript - Ticket# 1014193

The examples given on [the official site](https://dev.evernote.com/doc/articles/applescript.php) are not working. More specifically, this  

    tell application "Evernote"
        create notebook "AppleScriptNotebook1"
        create notebook "AppleScriptNotebook2"
        create note title "Note 1" with text "Moving note" notebook "AppleScriptNotebook1"
        move note 1 of notebook "AppleScriptNotebook1" to notebook "AppleScriptNotebook2"
    end tell 

will crash the Evernote client (true as of **vesion 6.0.11**). And this  

    tell application "Evernote"
        set nb1 to make notebook with properties {name:"AppleScriptNotebook1"}
        set name of notebook "AppleScriptNotebook1" to "AppleScriptNotebook2"
    end tell  

produces the following error:  

    error "Evernote got an error: Canâ€™t set notebook \"AppleScriptNotebook1\" to \"AppleScriptNotebook2\"." number -10006 from notebook "AppleScriptNotebook1"

### Random Upload Limit Error - Ticket# 953466

Attempting to update the `HTML content` of a note with basically the same content with get an error message saying

    error "Evernote got an error: Operation would exceed monthly upload allowance.
    
Barring some rare exceptions, users should not see this in EVND...
